# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

An end-to-end machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression, SMOTE, and StandardScaler.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is rare but highly impactful. The dataset is heavily imbalanced, so we apply techniques like SMOTE and Logistic Regression to detect fraud with high recall.

---

## ðŸ§  Approach

- Dataset: [Kaggle Credit Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Preprocessing:
  - Train-test split with stratified sampling
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
  - SMOTE for oversampling the minority class (fraud)
- Model: `LogisticRegression` with solver `'liblinear'`
- Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Classification Report
